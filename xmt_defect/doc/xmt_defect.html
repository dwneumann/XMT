    The XMT <I>Defect Tracking System</I> provides for the reporting,
    tracking, and controlling of Defect Reports and Defect Corrective
    Actions.
    <P>
    Reported defects may be assigned for corrective action and
    controlled throughout the correction process in accordance with
    local defect correction policies.  Several predefined policies are
    included for defect states and valid state transitions, for defect
    severity assignments, and for defect classification.
    <P>
    If required by local policy, authorization for changes in defect
    state may be controlled.
    <P>
    The defect database may be searched using ad-hoc or user-defined
    queries, and matching records output according to user-defined
    formats, such as HTML for online viewing or comma-separated-value
    for importing into other programs.
