Xhist (for "execution history") is a package which
assists in the diagnosis of defects in C-language
software as it executes in its target environment.
Xhist is made up of an instrumentation program, a
postprocessing program, and a function library.

The instrumentation program "xhist_instrument"
instruments the source code of the software under
test, and produces modified source code that is then
compiled and linked using the same compiler, linker,
and flags as the uninstrumented source.

The instrumented software, when compiled and executed,
records into a circular buffer the filename and line
number of each source statement as it is executed.
After the problem that is being diagnosed is
encountered, the circular buffer can be examined
directly (if on an embedded target) or the
circular buffer can be exported to a file, socket, or
serial device for interpretation by the developer of
the software under test.

The function library "libxhist" contains functions
which perform the writing of the circular buffer to a
file or socket descriptor.  The xhist_write() function
can be installed as a signal handler, as a termination
handler, or it can be invoked unconditionally, so that
the buffer can be exported using a number of means.
Use of the library is optional.  The developer may examine the
circular buffer directly in memory (if that is supported in
the target environment), or may choose to export the circular
buffer in another manner.

The postprocessing program "xhist_report" reads a
previously written circular buffer from file or stdin,
and presents a formatted listing of the last N source
statements executed by the software under test
immediately prior to being written.  The program
performs byteswapping if it detects that the
architecture in which the software under test executes
is different than the environment in which the
xhist_report program executes.  Use of the xhist_report
program is optional.  The developer may examine the exported
circular buffer in any manner he/she chooses.
