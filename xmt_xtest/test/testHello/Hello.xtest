# TEST 00.02   test whether Hello.jar outputs the expected "hello foo".

# verify that we are talking to jdb.
# first expect the jdb "initializing" string then a prompt.
# If we fail this, jdb is not ready to receive commands.
{ EXPECT( "Initializing jdb" ); 	} # first output of jdb

# launch the iut within jdb.  remember to send the newline!
{ SEND(   "run\n" );  			}	

# if we get this pattern, that's a PASS
