#   Package	: xmt_xtest
#   Purpose	: instrument files for whiteebox testing.  
#		  This adds clauses to if() statements and to try/catch blocks
#		  to allow forced failure of if tests and forced throwing of
#		  exceptions from try blocks.
#		  Xtest test scripts can then be written which set breakpoints
#		  at if and catch statements, change internal variable state to force
#		  failure of the if/try, and then allow program execution to continue.
#
#   Synopsis	: xtest_instrument [<options>] [file]
#   	 --help		print help message & exit.
#	 --unxtest	unxtest (i.e. clean) xtest instrumentation found in stdin, 
#			and write cleaned data stream to stdout.
