#   Package	: xmt_cm
#   Purpose	: instrument files for execution tracing 
#		  This is achieved by appending a write to a circular buffer after each
#		  semicolon terminating an executable statment.
#                 --xhist produces a map file at instrumentation time,
#                 for use by xhist_report to reconstruct the collected
#                 execution trace and present it in human-readable form.
#                 The map file is specified by
#		  --xhist_db=<pathname>
#
#   Synopsis	: xhist_instrument [<options>] [file]
#   	 --help		print help message & exit.
#   	 --verbose	list keyword labels with their expanded values to stdout.
#	 --fname=<pathspec>	read contents of file from STDIN but use <pathspec>
#			as the file name for instrumentation purposes
#	 --map=pathname	write execution history filename map to <pathname>.
#	 --unxhist	unxhist (i.e. clean) xhist instrumentation found in stdin, 
#			and write cleaned data stream to stdout.
