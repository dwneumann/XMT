#*   Package	: xmt_extern
#*   Synopsis	: source xmt_extern/proto/cshrc
#*   Purpose	: thirdparty dependency .cshrc additions
#*      XMT can be installed on an NFS-exported filesystem that is mounted by
#*      all developers to avoid each developer having to install and configure
#*      it locally. XMT packages can have dependencies on thirdparty tools.
#*      It may be convenient to install those here as well, and make them
#*      available via the same NFS mount. xmt_extern/bin is the recommended
#*      path for thirdparty software invoked by XMT.  $XMT/.cshrc and
#*      $XMT/.bashrc adds this to PATH by default.
