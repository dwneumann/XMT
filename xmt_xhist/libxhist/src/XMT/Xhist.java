/**
 * The Xhist class defines methods for extracting execution history from a running process.
 * <p>
 * Package:	XMT
 * Class:	Xhist
 * 
 * <p>
 * Xhist (for "execution history") is a package which assists in the diagnosis
 * of difficult bugs such as intermittent, non-reproducible bugs as the software
 * executes in its target environment.  Xhist is made up of an instrumentation
 * program "xhist_instrument", a postprocessing program "xhist_rport", and runtime
 * libraries for various languages, which generate the trace files at runtime.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The instrumentation program "xhist_instrument" instruments the source
 * code of the software under test (currnetly C, C++ and Java are supported),
 * and produces modified source code that is then compiled and linked using
 * the same compiler, linker, and flags as the uninstrumented source.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The instrumented software, when compiled and executed, records into a circular
 * buffer the filename and line number of each source statement as it is executed.
 * When the program misbehaves, the circular "trace log" can be examined directly
 * (if on an embedded target) or the trace log can be exported to a file,
 * socket, or serial device for interpretation by the developer of the software
 * under test.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Xhist class contains methods which perform the writing
 * of the trace log to a file or socket descriptor.  The Xhist.write()
 * method can be installed as a signal handler, as a termination handler, or
 * it can be invoked unconditionally, so that the trace log be exported using a
 * number of means.  The developer may also examine
 * the trace log directly in memory (if that is supported in the target
 * environment), or may choose to export it in another manner.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The postprocessing program "xhist_report" reads a previously written trace
 * log from file, and presents a human-readable formatted listing of the last N
 * source statements executed by the software immediately prior to the log
 * being written.  The program correctly performs byteswapping if the
 * architecture in which the software under test executes is different than
 * the environment in which the xhist_report program executes.  Use of the
 * xhist_report program is optional.
