Xhist (for "execution history") is a package which assists in the diagnosis
of defects in C-language software as it executes in its target environment.
The xhist package is made up of an instrumentation program, a postprocessing program,
and a function library which is linked into the program being testd.

The Perl script $XMT/xmt_xhist/bin/xhist_instrument instruments the source
code of the software under test, and produces modified source code that is
then compiled and linked using the same compiler, linker, and flags as the
uninstrumented source. "xhist_instrument" applies C syntax, C++ syntax or
Java syntax according to the file extension of the source file specified.

The instrumented software, when compiled and executed, records into a
circular buffer the filename and line number of each source statement as
it is executed.  When the problem that is being diagnosed is encountered,
the circular buffer can be examined directly in memory or the circular buffer
can be exported to a file, socket, or serial device for offline interpretation by
the developer of the software under test.

For efficiency on memory-constrained embedded targets, the filename is not
stored in the circular buffer in ASCII format but rather as a 2-byte hash
value that refers to a "map" file produced by xhist_instrument.  The name of
the mapfile and the version tag of the source code are stored in the buffer
so that the developer can refer to that mapfile and the correct codebase
even months or years later.

The function library "libxhist" (or equivalent Xhist.jar fir java)contains
functions which perform the writing of the circular buffer to a file or
socket descriptor.  The xhist_write() function can be installed as a signal
handler, as a termination handler, or it can be invoked unconditionally,
so that the buffer can be exported using a number of means.  Use of the
library is optional.  The developer may examine the circular buffer directly
in memory (if that is supported in the target environment), or may choose
to export the circular buffer in another manner.

The Perl script $XMT/xmt_xhist/binxhist_report reads a previously written
circular buffer (which is a binary file) from file or stdin, and presents a
formatted listing of the last N source statements executed by the software
under test immediately prior to being written.  The program performs
byteswapping if it detects that the architecture in which the software under
test executed is different than the environment in which the xhist_report
script executes.  Use of the xhist_report program is optional.  The developer
may examine the exported circular buffer in any manner he/she chooses.
